                 I apologize I can only stay for the first 30 minutes. I need to meet with a job candidate.

                 Bruce Clarke review, the link takes you to a google drive I just created: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fWcNo6E722vZA5lyibqvSSGUbc3QaYBP?usp=sharing

12:22:39 From Herbert M Sauro to Everyone:

                 Brandilyn, if at some point you understand this work, let me know!

                

12:24:04 From Herbert M Sauro to Everyone:

                 There is some overlap between Clarke's work and metabolic control analysis, for example Clarke's currents are MCA's elementary modes, and Clarke's kinetic orders are the elasticities.

                

12:24:46 From Steven S Andrews to Everyone:

                 I‚Äôm also reminded of Stuart Kauffman‚Äôs work on the number of attractors scales as the square root of the number of genes. Also Robert May‚Äôs work on stability and complexity of food webs.

                

12:25:35 From Herbert M Sauro to Everyone:

                 Yes you're right, there might be some connection there.

                 I think there is a latter paper which shows that number of attractors scales exponentially instead of as square root of number of genes

                 Interesting. I wasn‚Äôt aware of it. That‚Äôs a very different result!

                 That link isn‚Äôt working for me. Can you send the title, so I can google it?

                 Sorry. Here is the title: Superpolynomial Growth in the Number of Attractors in Kauffman Networks
