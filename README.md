# Modularity-Group

The hypothesis that biological systems are “modular” is widely accepted in systems biology, and there is a large body of literature on the topic. However, at this time there is no consensus on what the right definition of a module is, whether it should be a structural or a dynamic property or both, and what the concrete benefits of modularity are for an organism.

This interdisciplinary working group aims to approach this subject from both a biological and a computational direction. Through a series of presentations, discussions, and subgroups focused on specific topics, it provides a forum for researchers interested in this topic.

We are collecting resources, papers, and software around the theme of modularity, write papers, and provide means of communication for its members. The website is available at [Modularity-Group](https://laboratoryforsystemsmedicine.github.io/Modularity-Group/). 

## Announcements

There will be a workshop on Modularity at NITMB in April. More details coming soon!
